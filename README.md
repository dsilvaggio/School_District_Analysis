# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
An analysis was performed on data from a city school district in order to determine trends and patterns in school performance and testing proficiency. Math and reading test scores for analyzed, as well as school spending in order to help the school board make decisions regarding budget allotments. While performing our analysis, we were made aware of signs of academic dishonestly in our data set, specifically  among the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth grade students. Thus, these scores were removed from the data set and the rest of our analysis was performed.
